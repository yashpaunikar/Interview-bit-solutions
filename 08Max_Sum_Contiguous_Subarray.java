/*
O(n^3) solution is simple.
You look at every pair (i,j) and compute the sum of elements between i and j and then take the maximum of the sums.
Obviously, this is not the best solution.
Next improvement is O(n^2) when you notice that you donâ€™t need to sum up all the elements between i and j. 
You can just add A[j] to the sum you have already calculated in the previous loop from i to j-1.
However, we are looking for something better than N^2.
